1.Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number. 
2.Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end it should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered. 
3.Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user :
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 24 ....
4.Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
5.Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user. 
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +…………1/n.
6.Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Now, copy all the elements in an another array but in reverse order.
7. Consider an integer array, the number of elements in which is determined by the user. The elements are also taken as input from the user. Write a program to find those pair of elements that has the maximum and minimum difference among all element pairs.
8.Write a program to find all the duplicate elements in an array input by the user.
9.Take a few alphabets in an array and find out if the aplhabets are in alphabetical order.
10.Take an integer array, take input and copy all the even numbers in another array and all the odd numbers in the third array.
11. Take a two dimensional array of floats, find the sum of all the numbers in all the rows of the two dimensional array(one by one) and sum of all the elements in all the columns of array(one by one).
